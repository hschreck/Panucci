# Panucci

Panucci is a Ruby application that uses Sinatra to display system test results in a browser.  We're developing this to work in a PXE environment, but it will work anywhere you can install Ruby, Sinatra, memtester, and smartctl.  Linux only for now, though!

Hey!  User!  PC going out!  Come on!
